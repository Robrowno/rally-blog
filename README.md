# Rally Blog

The Rally Blog Website is a blog page about my rallying journey starting out as a driver and co-driver in the UK.

This is my first full-stack project, which contains blog posts about different Rally events I attend as a driver, co-driver or supporter. 

The aims of this website are:

1. To document my journey for readers
2. To inspire more people to take an interest in rallying and motorsport
3. To give readers different social media platforms to follow me on
4. To give readers to ability to use a contact form to contact me directly with queires 

As a full stack project, my personal aims out of this are to test my abilities in implementing Django in my fourth portfolio project for Code Institute, and to create a site which I will be eager to maintain and continue posting content on in future.

The website is deployed through Heroku, and the live link can be found here: #####################

# Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to construct my wireframes, as it's a trustworthy way of mapping out my project ideas, which I have used on all of my prior projects as well.
